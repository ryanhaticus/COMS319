      The `vh` unit is based on the height of the viewport. 1vh is equal to 1%
      of the viewport height. As the height of our viewport changes, so does the
      size of the text and width of the div.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1 style="font-size: 200%; background-color: blue">
        Ryan Huellen (Horizontal).
      </h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      The `%` unit is based on the width of the parent element. 1% is equal to
      1% of the parent element's width. As the width of the parent changes, so
      does the size of the text. As this element is at the root of our website,
      when we resize our window horizontally, we immediatley observe the size of
      the text changes since the div spans 100% of the width of the window.

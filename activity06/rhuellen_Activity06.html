                    Like the flower itself, the history of the rose is very
                    colorful. Roses have been naturally growing for over 35
                    million years! However, they were not known to be cultivated
                    until about 5,000 years ago.

                    Daisies are a very popular flower that can be found on every
                    continent other than Antarctica. They belong to one of the
                    largest known plant families and symbolized innocence, a
                    connotation that comes from the Victorian era. Based on what
                    color the daisy is, the flower can take on a different
                    meaning.

                    Did you know that orchids are one of the oldest flowering
                    plants known to man? Scientists speculate that orchids have
                    been around as long as 100 million years. Some of the most
                    popular types of the more than 30,000 that exist are
                    phalaenopsis, dendrobium, cattleya, and vanilla. Orchids
                    generally represent love, fertility, thoughtfulness, and
                    charm.
